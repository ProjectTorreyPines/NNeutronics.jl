# NNeutronics.jl

Surrogate model 1D neutronics model constructed from a database of 1D Monte Carlo neutronics simulations. The tritium breeding ratio (TBR) derived from this condensed model aligns closely with 3D Monte Carlo simulations, showcasing accuracy within a 15% margin.

Other quantities calculated are leakeage_energy spectrum, volumetric heating, flux.
